title: Cellular Automata Fire Spread Modeling
abstract: Large-scale land and structure losses each year due to both small and
  large wildfires, and the longer fire seasons due to anthropogenic climate
  change make the prediction of fire spread a matter of concern. There are
  multiple physical fire spread models, but a Bayesian categorical model can
  also be used to determine which factors are particularly important when
  predicting fire spread. To study this a multi-state cellular automata model
  was used to predict the spread of a controlled wildfire. Information like land
  usage, wind speed, and other local covariates along with information from
  neighboring cells was used in the prediction. The model takes into
  consideration how the rate of spread varies both over time and through space.
